Had a bunch of issues pushing to the old repository from my machine so I made a new one on Jan 31 2021. Much better.

Website: https://blockhead7360.com/dmslauncher

Changelog: https://repo.blockhead7360.com/changelogs/swda-10010

The DMSLauncher was originally created in 2017 but I still occasionally update it for fun (check out the changelog for dates). It's a computer application that installs modded Minecraft clients for players on all kinds of modded servers and keeps the client up to date with any mod changes made by the server owner. It's not meant to be publicly available at the moment; it's just for me and my friends.
