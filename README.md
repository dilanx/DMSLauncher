The DMSLauncher was originally created in 2017 but I still occasionally update it for fun (check out the changelog for dates). It's a computer application that installs modded Minecraft clients for players on all kinds of modded servers and keeps the client up to date with any mod changes made by the server owner. It's not meant to be publicly available at the moment; it's just for me and my friends.
